# Etch-a-Sketch

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

Used Youtube video tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyhuaXeuyGo
This tutorial used grid instead of flexbox, so I modified my code so layout is flex instead of grid.
Got ideas from Davidngu3 here: https://github.com/davidngu3/etch-a-sketch

Notes:
Boxes update on input change, not when button is clicked (might fix later).
Disregard the reset.css file. Was part of tutorial but not needed anymore.
